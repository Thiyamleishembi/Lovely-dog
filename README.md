   It was about 10 years ago.The day was warm and pleasant.It was summer season.Everybody would have like to rest
   and enjoy theSunday.As usual tuku goes to the field with his owner but that day his owner did not go since it 
   was Sunday.Everyone of us just want to relax on Sunday.
    
   Tuku insisted his owner to the field rolling here and there. But the owner refused to.

   But the call of the excitement of the field was overwhelming. So he just stood up and went to the field.
   On the way he met my friend, his owner's nephew. My friend followed him to the field.

 They went to the field located at the eastern part of Thonjaorok river. They reach the field. They played, jumped, hop, run
 and chase each other.

  But suddenly Tuku sensed something unusual. He straightened up his ears and look here and there.

  Then he saw a pack of jackals forwarding towards them. The fun trip was turned into fear. They ran back crossing the river finding their way home. But the jackals were catching up fast. Sadly they surrounded my friend and Tuku. Tuku started growling and start fighting them protecting my friend. Then my friend ran for his life. But one jackal was chasing him and Tuku saw it. He was hurt badly
and managed to slip away from them. Then he caught the jackal chasing my friend.There was a deadly fight between Tuku and the jackals.

My friend managed to reach home safely and reported about what happened. Then his uncles and their friends went rushing back to the field. Sadly they found Tuku dead. Then they were furious at his death and search for the jackals. They couldn't found them.With a broken heart they returned home carrying the body without soul.They buried him with respect. Most of my friend's families cried.
My friend couldn't bear with the  sorrow and he cried very hard.

Now it's been many years but my friend never forgets his hero and loyal Tuku. AS a remembrance, My friend continues to call every dog after him Tuku.

 Loyalty is also just a natural behavior for dogs. Dogs are pack animals, meaning they are social creatures who prefer the company of other animals. This behavior is a survival mechanism too. ... Many dog trainers and other animal experts believe this pack mentality also causes dogs to be loyal to their humans.Love your dogs because they love you.
